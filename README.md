# CleanFront

### Description

Welcome to CleanFront, a GitHub reference project designed to provide a solid foundation for implementing and structuring Clean Architecture at the frontend level. Tailored for those seeking to grasp and adopt best practices in frontend application development, CleanFront not only serves as a clear example of Clean Architecture but also includes a straightforward implementation of authentication using Firebase for security management. The project further showcases effective application state management through the utilization of Redux.

Explore this repository for a detailed insight into organizing, structuring, and maintaining robust and scalable frontend code with Clean Architecture. But that's not all! CleanFront also serves as a guide for efficient error handling, demonstrates the use of lazy loading for module loading efficiency, and provides guidance on setting up effective public and private routing in a React application. We hope you find this reference invaluable on your development journey!

### Feautures

- **React with TypeScript:** The project is developed with Vite and React with TypeScript.

- **Clean Code Architecture:** The project follows a Clean Code architecture, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

- **Redux for Global State Management:** Redux is used to manage global application state, allowing for efficient data management and synchronization.

- **Storybook for Component Library:** The project includes my custom library of components built with Storybook. rf-sb-components( https://github.com/RamiroFraysse/rf-sb-components )

- **Axios for Data Fetching:** Axios is utilized for making HTTP requests. It also includes an interceptor for error handling, allowing for the display of appropriate error messages.

- **React Router Dom for Routing:** React Router Dom is used for handling client-side routing. Additionally, custom guards are implemented to manage route privacy and access control
